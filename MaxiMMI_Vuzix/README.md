Title: Multimodal Task-Oriented Operating Systems for Flexible and User-Centered Human-Machine Interaction on Production Machines (Multimodale, aufgabenorientierte Bediensysteme zur flexiblen und nutzerzentrierten Mensch-Maschine-Interaktion an Produktionsmaschinen)

Abstract: The MaxiMMI lab software includes a tablet-app, a smartwatch program, and a data glasses program to facilitate human-machine interaction. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of these devices in remote monitoring and work progress, specifically in terms of reaction time, error rate, and user satisfaction.

Android BluetoothChat Sample
===================================

This sample shows how to implement two-way text chat over Bluetooth between two Android devices, using
all the fundamental Bluetooth API capabilities.

Introduction
------------

This sample should be run on two Android devices at the same time, to establish a two-way chat over
Bluetooth between the devices. Select "Made discoverable" in overflow menu on one device and click
on the Bluetooth icon on the other one, to find the device and establish the connection.

The sample demonstrates the following, using the [Bluetooth API][1]:

1. [Setting up][2] Bluetooth
2. [Scanning][3] for other Bluetooth devices
3. [Querying][4] the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
4. [Establishing RFCOMM][5] channels/sockets
5. [Connecting][6] to a remote device
6. [Transfering][7] data over Bluetooth
