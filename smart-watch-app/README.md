Title: Multimodal Task-Oriented Operating Systems for Flexible and User-Centered Human-Machine Interaction on Production Machines (Multimodale, aufgabenorientierte Bediensysteme zur flexiblen und nutzerzentrierten Mensch-Maschine-Interaktion an Produktionsmaschinen)

Abstract: The MaxiMMI lab software includes a tablet-app, a smartwatch program, and a data glasses program to facilitate human-machine interaction. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of these devices in remote monitoring and work progress, specifically in terms of reaction time, error rate, and user satisfaction.
